# Cookie Stand project for Week 2

This is the class project for Week 2 of the Code Fellows 201 course.

2015-11-03: Jared driving, Dave navigating, we built a constructor to replace the five seperate objects, then changed the display from a list for each object to a single table.

Any questions can be directed at: cookiestand@bodhitech.org
